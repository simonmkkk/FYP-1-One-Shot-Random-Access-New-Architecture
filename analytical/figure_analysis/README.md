# Figure Analysis Submodule Architecture Documentation

Figure analysis calculation submodule responsible for generating analytical data for Figure 1, 2, and 3-5.

**File List:**
- `__init__.py` - Submodule export interface, exports all figure analysis functions
- `figure1_analysis.py` - Figure 1 analytical calculation, calculates exact and approximate formulas for NS,1/N and NC,1/N
- `figure2_analysis.py` - Figure 2 analytical calculation, calculates approximation error analysis based on Figure 1 results
- `figure345_analysis.py` - Figure 3-5 combined analytical calculation, simultaneously calculates three performance metrics: P_S, T_a, P_C
